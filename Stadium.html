    <p>Anfield is a football stadium in the area of Anfield, Liverpool, England, 
    which has been the home of Liverpool since their formation in 1892.</p>
    <p>
    The stadium has a seating capacity of 61,276, making it the fifth largest stadium in England.
    It was originally the home of Everton from 1884 to 1891, before they moved to Goodison Park 
    after a dispute with the club president.</p>
    <p>The stadium has four stands: the Spion Kop, the Main Stand, the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand and 
    the Anfield Road End. The record attendance of 61,905 was set at a match between Liverpool 
    and Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1952. The ground converted to an all-seater stadium in 1994 
    as a result of the Taylor Report, which reduced its capacity.</p>

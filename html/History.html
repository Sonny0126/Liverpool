                    Liverpool Football Club </a>is a professional football club
                based in Liverpool, England. The club competes in the Premier League,
                the top tier of English football. Founded in 1892, the club joined the
                Football League the following year and has played its home games at Anfield
                since its formation. Liverpool is one of the most valuable and widely supported clubs in the world.

                Domestically, the club has won nineteen league titles, eight FA Cups, a record ten League Cups
                and sixteen FA Community Shields. In international competitions, the club has won six European Cups,
                three UEFA Cups, four UEFA Super Cups—all English records—and one FIFA Club World Cup. Liverpool
                established itself as a major force in domestic football in the 1960s under Bill Shankly, before
                becoming perennial title challengers at home and abroad under Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish
                who led the club to a combined eleven league titles and four European Cups through the 1970s and 80s.
                Liverpool won two further European Cups in 2005 and 2019 under the management of Rafael Benítez and
                Jürgen Klopp, respectively; the latter led Liverpool to a 19th league title in 2020, the club's first
                during the Premier League era.

                Already nicknamed "The Reds", it was under Shankly in the 60s that the team first adopted the
                distinctive
                all-red home strip which has been used ever since. Also adopted under Shankly's tenure was the club's
                anthem
                "You'll Never Walk Alone". The Reds compete in the local Merseyside derby against fellow Liverpool club
                Everton,
                often referred to simply as "The Blues". As the two most decorated clubs in England, and inter-city
                rivals,
                Liverpool also has a long-standing rivalry with the Manchester club Manchester United.

                The club's supporters have been involved in two major tragedies. The Heysel Stadium disaster, where
                escaping
                fans were pressed against a collapsing wall at the 1985 European Cup Final in Brussels, resulted in 39
                deaths,
                most of which were Italians and Juventus fans. Liverpool were given a six-year ban from European
                competitions,
                and all other English clubs received a five-year ban. The Hillsborough disaster in 1989, where 97
                Liverpool
                supporters died in a crowd crush against perimeter fencing, led to the elimination of fenced standing
                terraces
                in favour of all-seater stadiums in the top two tiers of English football. Prolonged campaigning for
                justice
                saw further coroner's inquests, commissions and independent panels that ultimately exonerated the fans.
